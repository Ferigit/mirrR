# mirrR

mirrR is a smart mirror React/Node app that can run on a Raspberry Pi

## How to run

Open your terminal and copy and paste these commands:

`git clone https://github.com/seanyesmunt/mirrR && cd mirrR`

`npm i && npm start`

Then go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### News/Twitter/Weather

To see news, Twitter, or the weather component, you will have to get the corresponding api keys.

[News (NY Times)](https://developer.nytimes.com/signup) Choose "Top Stories V1" from the dropdown.

[Twitter](https://apps.twitter.com/) You will need to signup and create a new app.

[Weather (forecast.io)](https://developer.forecast.io/)

The Mirror will work fine without the API keys, it will just show a message if you try to use an app without an API key.
